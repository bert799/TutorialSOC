This is repository contains the VHDL code for a MIPS architecture with working pipeline, forwarding and stall, it was run on a DE0-CV board with a Cyclone V FPGA architecture. It is running a simple sprite animation loop coded in assembly language
made possible by a VGA driver which was provided by the professor Paulo Carlos Santos teacher of the subject *"Design de computadores"* at Insper Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa.
